# Contributing

## Overview
Welcome, and thanks for having an interest in contributing to the Huff Language and related repositories!

Contributing to Huff Language is not just limited to writing code. It can mean a wide array of things, such as participating in discussions in our [discord server](https://discord.gg/h8pkspwx) or reporting issues. A general process for contributing can be followed.

1. Begin by searching for new issues and discussions in the [discord servers](https://discord.gg/h8pkspwx) pr-and-issues or feature-discussion channels.
2. Participate in thoughtful and considerate discussion on that issue.
3. If you decide you would like to contribute to the issue
    - Ensure that your feature proposal is accepted 
    - Ensure that nobody else has begun working on the issue. If someone else has, make sure to contact them to collaborate on the feature.

ðŸ‘‰ **Note:** For minor problems like typos, you do not need to open an issue to submit a PR. However for more complex features/problems, a design discussion must take place either in a Github Issue or the Discord server.
